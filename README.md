# Skittering Crustaceans

A deep-sea simulator developed in Rust over the course of `Advanced Programming Skills - Rust (CSCI-541)` at RIT, instructed by Professor Matthew Fluet. 
Inspired by colony sims such as Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld.

This repository is a copy of the original at the time of submission, and reflects the team's collective effort over the semester.
The only files omitted were the professor's comments/feedback regarding our progress, in an effort to respect his privacy, as well as the demo video,
which is now linked below to save space.

Design documentation and justifications can be found under `docs/`, and the program itself can be found under `deep-sea-sim`. 
You can run the program yourself by calling `cargo run` inside of `deep-sea-sim`, assuming you have rust installed.

Final team members*:

- Matthew Thompson
	- Developed most of the underlying game logic, including the main processing loop, the AI controllers, and the main board setup.
- Eric Barron
	- Developed the UI/front-end components of the application, as well as some of the game logic.

* Due to extenuating circumstances, a third team member had to leave partway through the project.
